Iâ€™m a big fan of mixing up our dinners with some meatless meals. Iâ€™m not a vegetarian (far from it ðŸ™‚ ) but I also donâ€™t like my family eating heavy servings of meat every single night.

One of my favorite vegetarian meals is [black bean burgers](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/the-best-black-bean-burger/) â€” so dang easy and TASTY! I love that I usually always have what I need to make them. I also really love this [creamy pesto tortellini](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/creamy-pesto-tortellini-pasta-salad/).

I feel like Mexican flavored dishes are even easier to make meatless because of all of the delicious flavor and spices you can add to the dish. These [sweet potato and black bean enchiladas](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/sweet-potato-and-black-bean-enchiladas/), and these [black bean and corn quesadillas](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/black-bean-and-corn-quesadillas/), for example, always leave us feeling satisfied.

What I really love about these Mexican inspired lentil tacos are how hearty the mixture isâ€“you wont even miss the meat! They are soo flavorful, and delicious, and one of my absolute favorite vegetarian instant pot recipes.

The Instant Pot makes this meal even more genius. Throw everything in the pot, and give it a stir. Thatâ€™s it! Cook it for 15 minutes on high pressure, and youâ€™re ready to eat. No babysitting the lentils, no stirring the pot. You donâ€™t even need to let the pressure naturally release!

This Instant pot lentil tacos recipe is also really easily adaptable to what you have on hand.

Substitution Ideas:

**Chopped onion for onion powder.**

Use the saute function on the instant pot to saute 1 cup chopped onion in a little bit of oil, before adding the rest of the ingredients.

**Water for chicken broth.**

You can use water if you donâ€™t have chicken broth. I just like the extra boost of flavor that the chicken broth adds. Or you could add 4 teaspoons/4 chicken bullion cubes to the water.

**Tomato sauce instead of salsa.**

**Additional veggies:**

Try adding corn, diced green chilies (if you like it spicy), or another chopped vegetable, like zucchini.
