# Initial Setup

## Add and Existing SSH Key

If you already have an SSH key registered with your Git service, you can add it on a new machine with:

1. Copy the private key to `~/.ssh` change it's mode to 600.  Give it a memorable name.   For example `id_rsa.gh` for GitHub.  Copy the public key to `~/.ssh` and change it's mode to 644.   Give it a corresponding name, for example `id_rsa.pub.gh`.
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/.ssh
    cp /mnt/somestorage/*.gh .
    chmod 600 id_rsa.gh
    chmod 644 id_rsa.pub.gh
    ```
    
2. Configure SSH to use this key when connecting to the Git server (in this case, Github) by adding a section to `~/.ssh/config`:
    
    ```bash
    Host github.com
    	HostName github.com
    	User git
    	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.gh
    ```
