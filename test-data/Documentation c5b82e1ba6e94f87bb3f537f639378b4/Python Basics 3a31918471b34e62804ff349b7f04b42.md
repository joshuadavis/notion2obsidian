Basic Python tools for Python 3 development.

## pip - Package manager

`pip` is the standard package manager for Python.  It is how you install and update Python libraries and features.

## venv - Isolated Python environments (the built in version)

`venv` is the built in (as of Python 3) virtual environment system.  It is lighter weight and newer than `virtualenv` and seems to be the recommended way.

Create a virtual env: `python3 -m venv env`

Activate a virtual env: `source ./env/bin/activate`

# Project First Time Setup

What to do after you get a Python project from version control:

1. Create a virtual Python environment for the project:
    
    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv env
    ```
    
    This will create an `env` directory with the Python environment in it.  This directory should be ignored by version control (e.g. in `.gitignore`)
    
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    $ source ./env/bin/activate
    ```
    
    This will launch a sub-shell with environment variables, PATH, etc that will use the virtual environment.
    
3. (Optional) Update pip:
    
    ```bash
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    
4. Update all the dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
